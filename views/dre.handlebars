            <p style="font-family:verdana">After graduating from Georgia Tech I started working for Keysight Technologies where I have been
                developing cloud applicatons for customers. My daily tasks involve building applications that allow clients to
                communicaton with our service through both HTTP and gRPC transport layers, in which the
                app is placed within a Docker containers and and depoyed via Kubernettes. I have extensively worked 
                with PostgresSql for our apps, and I'm currently working on incorporating AWS ECS and EC2 into our data storage strategy.
                While I would not consider myself an expert in front end development, I have enough experience using Angular, HTML, and CSS
                to get me through most requirements.<br><br>
                 
                My hobbies are running, attending Atlanta United games, and reading. I compete
                in many national races such as the Peachtree Road Race here in Atlanta, and I will be
                competing in the Chicago marathon October 2020/2021(pending COVID-19).
